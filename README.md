# What's Kapow!

Say you have nice cozy **shell command** that solves a problem for you. Kapow! let us easily **turn that into an HTTP API**. 

## Let's see this with an example

We want to expose **log entries** for files not found on our **Apache Web Server**, as an HTTP API. With Kapow! we just need to write this file: 

```bash
[apache-host]$ cat search-apache-errors.pow
kapow route add /apache-errors - <<-'EOF'
   cat /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep "File does not exist" | kapow set /response/body
EOF
```
    
and then, run it using Kapow!

```bash
[apache-host]$ kapow server --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 search-apache-errors.pow
```

finally, we can read from the just-defined endpoint:

```bash
[another-host]$ curl http://apache-host:8080/apache-errors

## Why Kapow! shines in these cases

- We can share information without having grant SSH access to anybody.
- We want to limit what is executed.
- We can share information easily over HTTP.
