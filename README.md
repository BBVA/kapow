# Kapow! for the impatient

## Kapow! Superpowers

Kapow! gives you:

 * A very simple way to turn any shell executable into an API
 * A remote administration API
 * Opinion free shell integration

## Kapow! Curses

Kapow! can't help when:

 * You need high throughput: Kapow! spawn a new executable every HTTP call
 * You must perform complex logic to attend the request: never use Kapow! if
   your executables doesn't perform al least 90% of the hard work
 * You are building a huge application


## When Kapow! is your best ally:

 * Easy command + Hard API = Kapow! to the rescue
 * SSH for one command? Kapow! allow you to share only that command
 * Remote instrumentation of several machines? make it easy with Kapow!
