Installing *Kapow!*
===================

*Kapow!* has a reference implementation in `Go` that is under active
development right now.  If you want to start using *Kapow!* you can choose from
several options.


Download and Install a Binary
-----------------------------

Binaries for several platforms are available from the
`releases <https://github.com/BBVA/kapow/releases>`_ section, visit the latest
release page and download the binary corresponding to the platfom and
architecture you want to install *Kapow!* in.


GNU/Linux
+++++++++

Install the downloaded binary using the following command as a privileged user.

.. parsed-literal::

   # install kapow\_\ |version|\ _linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/kapow


macOS
+++++

Install the downloaded binary using the following command as a privileged user.

.. parsed-literal::

   # install kapow\_\ |version|\ _darwin_amd64 /usr/local/bin/kapow


WindowsÂ®
++++++++

Unzip the downloaded zipfile and move `kapow.exe` to a directory of your choice;
then update the system :envvar:`PATH` variable to include that directory.
Note that the zipfile also includes the LICENSE.


Install the package with ``go get``
-----------------------------------

If you already have `installed and configured <https://golang.org/cmd/go/>`_
the :program:`go` runtime in the host where you want to run *Kapow!*, simply
run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ go get -v github.com/BBVA/kapow

Note that *Kapow!* leverages `Go modules`_, so you can target specific releases:

.. parsed-literal::

  $ GO111MODULE=on go get -v github.com/BBVA/kapow@v\ |version|
  go: finding github.com v\ |version|
  go: finding github.com/BBVA v\ |version|
  go: finding github.com/BBVA/kapow v\ |version|
  go: downloading github.com/BBVA/kapow v\ |version|
  go: extracting github.com/BBVA/kapow v\ |version|

Include *Kapow!* in your Container Image
----------------------------------------

If you want to include *Kapow!* in a `Docker` image, you can add the binary
directly from the releases section.  Below is an example :file:`Dockerfile` that
includes *Kapow!*.

.. parsed-literal::

  FROM debian:stable-slim

  ADD https://github.com/BBVA/kapow/releases/download/v\ |version|\ /kapow\_\ |version|\ _linux_amd64 /usr/bin/kapow

  RUN chmod 755 /usr/bin/kapow

  ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/kapow"]

If the container is intended for running the server and you want to dinamically
configure it, remember to include a ``--control-bind`` param with an external
bind address (e.g., ``0.0.0.0``) and to map all the needed ports in order to get
access to the control interface.

After building the image you can run the container with:

.. code-block:: console

  $ docker run --rm -i -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/whatever.pow:/opt/whatever.pow kapow:latest server /opt/whatever.pow

With the ``-v`` parameter we map a local file into the container's filesystem so
we can use it to configure our *Kapow!* server on startup.
