Quick Start Guide
=================

We'll explain a simple example to help you understand what *Kapow!* can do and
why it is so awesome :-).


Scenario
--------

In this example we'll consider that our scenario is a corporate network like
this:

.. _quickstart_image:
.. image:: /_static/network.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%

Our organization has an external host that acts as a bridge between our intranet
an the public Internet.

.. admonition:: Goal
   :class: hint

   Our team must be able to check if the **Internal Host** is alive on an
   ongoing basis.


Limitations and Constraints
---------------------------

#. We don't want to grant access to the **External Host** to anybody.
#. We don't want to manage VPNs or any similar solutions to access
   **Internal Host** from the Internet.
#. We want to limit the actions that a user can perform in our intranet
   while it is checking if **Internal Host** is alive.
#. We want to use the most standard mechanism.  Easy to use and automate.
#. We don't have a budget to invest in a custom solution.


The Desired Solution
--------------------

After analyzing the problem and with our goal in mind, we conclude that it
is enough to use a simple :command:`ping` to **Internal Host**.

So, the next step is to analyze how to perform the :command:`ping`.


Accessing via SSH to External Host
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If we choose this option, then, for every person that needs to check the status
of **Internal Host** we need to create a user in the **External Host** and
grant them `ssh` access.

.. admonition:: Verdict

   This is **not a good idea**, because:

   #. We'd need to manage users (violates a constraint).
   #. We'd need to grant users access to a host (violates a constraint).
   #. We would not be able to control what options the user could provide to
      :command:`ping` (violates a constraint).


Develop and Deploy a Custom Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

OK, this approach could be the best choice for our organization, but:

#. We'd need to start a new project, develop, test, manage and maintain it.
#. We'd need to wait for for the development to be production ready.
#. We'd need a budget.  Even if we have developers in our organization, their time
   it's not free.

.. admonition:: Verdict

   This is **not a good idea**, because:

   #. We'd need to spend money (violates a constraint).
   #. We'd need to spend time (and time is money, see reason #1).


Using *Kapow!* (spoiler: it's the winner!)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ok, let's analyze *Kapow!* and check if it is compatible with our constraints:

#. *Kapow!* is Open Source, so it's also **free as in beer**.
#. By using *Kapow!* we don't need to code our own solution, so **we don't have
   to waste time**.
#. By using *Kapow!* we can run any command in the **External Host**,
   limiting the command parameters, so **it's safe**.
#. By using *Kapow!* we can launch any system command as an `HTTP API` easily, so
   **we don't need to grant login access to External Host to anybody**.

.. admonition:: Verdict

   *Kapow!* is the **best** choice, because it satisfies all of our
   requirements.


Using *Kapow!*
--------------

In order to get our :ref:`example scenario <quickstart_image>` working we need
to follow the steps below.


Install *Kapow!*
++++++++++++++++

Follow the :ref:`installation instructions <installation>`.


Write a :file:`ping.pow` File
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*Kapow!* uses plain text files (called `pow` files) where the endpoints you want
to expose are defined.

For each endpoint, you can decide which commands get executed.

For our example we need a file like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cat ping.pow
    kapow route add /ping -c 'ping -c 1 10.10.10.100 | kapow set /response/body'

Let's dissect this beast piece by piece:

#. ``kapow route add /ping`` - adds a new `HTTP API` endpoint at ``/ping``
   path in the *Kapow!* server.  You have to use the ``GET`` method to invoke
   the endpoint.
#. ``-c`` - after this parameter, we write the system command that *Kapow!*
   will run each time the endpoint is invoked.
#. ``ping -c 1 10.10.10.100`` - sends one `ICMP ping packet` to the **Internal
   Host**.
#. ``| kapow set /response/body`` - writes the output of :command:`ping` to the
   body of the response, so you can see it.


Launch the Service
++++++++++++++++++

At this point, we only need to launch :program:`kapow` with our :file:`ping.pow`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ kapow server ping.pow


Consume the Service
+++++++++++++++++++

Now we can call our newly created endpoint by using our favorite `HTTP` client.
In this example we're using :program:`curl`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl http://external.host/ping
    PING 10.10.100 (10.10.100): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 10.10.100: icmp_seq=0 ttl=55 time=1.425 ms

*et voil√† !*


Under the Hood
++++++++++++++

To understand what's happening under the hood with *Kapow!* let's see the
following diagram:

As you can see, *Kapow!* provides the necessary *mojo* to turn a **system
command** into an `HTTP API`.
