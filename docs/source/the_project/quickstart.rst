Quick Start Guide
=================

We'll explain a simple example to help you understand what *Kapow!* can do and
why it is so awesome :-).


Scenario
--------

In this example we'll consider that our scenario is a corporate network like
this:

.. _quickstart_image:
.. image:: /_static/network.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%

Our organization has an external host that acts as a bridge between our intranet
an the public Internet.

**Our goal: Our team must be able to check if the** ``Internal Host``
**is alive on an ongoing basis.**


Limitations and Constraints
---------------------------

1. We **don't want** to **grant access** to the ``External Host`` to
   anybody.
2. We **don't want** to manage VPNs or any similar solutions to access
   ``Internal Host`` from the Internet.
3. We **want to limit the actions** that a user can perform in our intranet
   while it is checking if ``Internal Host`` is alive.
4. We **want** to use the most standard mechanism.  Easy to use and automate.
5. We **don't have a budget** to invest in a custom solution.


The Desired Solution
--------------------

After analyzing the problem and with our goal in mind, we conclude that it
is enough **to use a simple** ``ping`` **to** ``Internal Host``.

So, the next step is to **analyze how to perform the ping.**


Accessing via SSH to ``External Host``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If we choose this option, then, for every person that needs to check the status
of ``Internal host``, we need to create a user in the ``External Host`` and
grant them ``SSH`` access.

Conclusion: **Not a good idea.**

Reasons:

  1. We need to manage users (violates a constraint.)
  2. We need to grant usesrs access to a host (violates a constraint.)
  3. We can't control what ``ping`` options the user can use to ping ``Internal Host`` (violates a constraint.)


Develop and Deploy a Custom Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ok, this approach could be the best choice for our organization, but:

1. We'll need to start a new project, develop, test, manage and maintain it.
2. We need to wait for for the development to be production ready.
3. We need a budget.  Even if we have developers in our organization, their time
   it's not free.

Conclusion: **Not a good idea.**

Reasons:

1. Need to spend money (violates a constraint.)
2. Need to spend time (and time is money, see reason #1)


Using *Kapow!* (spoiler: it's the winner!)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ok, let's analyze *Kapow!* and check if it is compatible with our constraints:

1. *Kapow!* is Open Source, so it's also **free as in beer**.
2. By using *Kapow!* we don't need to code our own solution, so we **don't have
   to waste time**.
3. By using *Kapow!* we can run any command in the ``External Host``
   limiting the command parameters, so **it's safe**.
4. By using *Kapow!* we can launch any system command as an ``HTTP API`` easily, so
   **we don't need to grant login access to** ``External Host`` **to
   anybody**.

Conclusion: *Kapow!* **is the best choice.**

Reasons: It satisfies all of our requirements.


Using Kapow!
------------

In order to get our example :ref:`Scenario <quickstart_image>` working we need
to follow the steps below.


Install Kapow!
++++++++++++++

Follow the :doc:`Installing Kapow! <install_and_configure>` instructions.


Write a ``ping.pow`` File
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

*Kapow!* uses plain text files (called ``pow`` files) so you can define the
endpoints you want to expose the system command with.  For our example we need a
file like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cat ping.pow
    kapow route add /ping -c 'ping -c 1 10.10.10.100 | kapow set /response/body'

Explanation:

1. ``kapow route add /ping`` - adds a new ``HTTP API`` endpoint at ``/ping``
   path in the *Kapow!* server.  You have to use ``GET`` method to invoke the
   endpoint.
2. ``-c`` - after this parameter we write the system command that *Kapow!*
   will run each time the endpoint is invoked.
3. ``ping -c 1 10.10.10.100`` - sends 1 ping package to the host
   *10.10.10.100*, i.e. ``Internal Host``.
4. ``| kapow set /response/body`` - writes the output of `ping` to the body
   of the response, so you can see it.


Launch the Service
++++++++++++++++++

At this point we only need to launch ``kapow`` with our ``ping.pow``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ kapow server ping.pow


Consume the Service
+++++++++++++++++++

Now we can call our newly created endpoint by using our favorite HTTP client.
In this example we're using ``curl``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl http://external.host/ping
    PING 10.10.100 (10.10.100): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 10.10.100: icmp_seq=0 ttl=55 time=1.425 ms

et voil√† !


Under the Hood
++++++++++++++

To understand what's happening under the hood with *Kapow!* let's see the
following diagram:

As you can see, *Kapow!* provides the necessary *magic* to turn a **system
command** into an ``HTTP API``.
