Your First Day at Work
======================

**Senior**

  Welcome to *ACME Inc.*  This is your first day here, right?

**Junior**

  Hi!  Yes!  And I am eager to start working.  What will be my first task?

**Senior**

  First, let me help you get acquainted with our infrastructure.

**Junior**

  OK.

**Senior**

  We have two Linux boxen that provide services to our employees.

  1. The Corporate Server:  Provides email, database and web services.

  2. The Backup Server:  It is used to store backup of the important
     company data.

**Junior**

  That's it?  OK, just like Google, then.

**Senior**

  Smartass...

**Junior**

  (chuckles nervously).

**Senior**

  Well, I think is time for you to start with your first task.  It just so
  happens that we received another request to backup the database from the
  projects team.
