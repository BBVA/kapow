Your First Day at Work
======================

**Senior**

  Welcome to ACME Inc.  This is your first day here, right?

**Junior**

  Hi! I am excited to start working.  What will be my first task?

**Senior**

  First let me explain to you what is our infrastructure.

**Junior**

  Ok.

**Senior**

  We have two Linux machines that provide services to our employees.

  1. The Corporate Server:  Provides email, database and web services.

  2. The Backup Server:  It is used to store backup of the important
     company data. 

**Junior**

  That's it? Ok, just like Google.

**Senior**

  Well, I think is time for you to start with your first task.  It just
  so happens that we received another request to backup the database
  from the projects team.
