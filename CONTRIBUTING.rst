Want to hack on ``Kapow!``? Awesome! Here are a few instructions to get you
started. They are probably not perfect, please let us know if anything feels
wrong or incomplete.

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** this repo
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest commits from **upstream** before making a pull
request!

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If
there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you'll receive feedback on
what to improve.

Submit unit tests for your changes. Go has a great testing framework built
in; use it! Take a look at existing tests for inspiration. Run the full test
suite on your branch before submitting a pull request.

Make sure you include relevant updates or additions to documentation
when creating or modifying features.

Before creating a Pull Request
------------------------------

Please, run the tests :)
