CAVEAT EMPTOR
=============

**Warning!!! Kapow!** is under **heavy development** and `specification </spec>`_;
the provided code is a Proof of Concept and the final version will not even
share programming language.  Ye be warned.


How it was born
---------------

Some awesome history is coming.


Kapow! for the impatient
========================

When you need to **share** a ``command`` but **not** a complete remote ``ssh
access``, Kapow!  will help you with the power of HTTP:

Kapow! allows you to write a litte script that will **serve an executable as REST
service**.  This script will let you define how to connect HTTP and the  Shell
using Kapow!'s shell abstractions to the HTTP world. See it to believe:

Superpowers
-----------

Kapow! gives you:

 * A very simple way to turn any shell **executable into an API**
 * A **remote administration** API
 * A way to define the integration in you own terms, obligations-free!


Curses
------

Kapow! can't help when:
-----------------------

 * You need high throughput: Kapow! spawns a new executable for every HTTP call
 * You must perform complex logic to attend the request: never use Kapow! if
   your executables don't perform al least 90% of the hard work
 * You are building a huge application


When it is your best friend:
--------------------------

 * Easy command + Hard API = Kapow! to the rescue
 * SSH for one command?  Kapow! allows you to share only that command
 * Remote instrumentation of several machines?  Make it easy with Kapow!
