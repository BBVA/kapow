Remote tcpdump sniffer with source filtering
============================================

1. Add any filter you want to the tcpdump command inside `tcpdump.pow` to filter
   any traffic you don't want to be sniffed!
2. For the sake of simplicity run `sudo kapow server tcpdump.pow`. In a
   production environment tcpdump should be run with the appropiate permissions
   but kapow can (and should) run as an unprivilieged user.
3. In your local machine run:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/sniff/<network-interface> | sudo wireshark -k -i -
   ```
   Again, for the sake of simplicity Wireshark is running as root. If you don't want
   to run it this way follow this guide:

4. Profit!
